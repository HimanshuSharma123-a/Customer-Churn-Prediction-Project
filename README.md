# Customer Churn Prediction Project 2025

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains customer details such as demographic information, account details, and services used by customers, with the target variable being whether the customer has churned or not.

## Steps
1. Data cleaning: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and remove irrelevant data.
2. Data modification: Select features and split data into training/testing sets.
3. Modeling: Build Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
4. Evaluation: Use accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for performance analysis.
5. Visualization: Compare model accuracy and analyze churn distribution.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Structure
- **Data/**: Contains datasets.
- **Scripts/**: Python scripts for cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling.
- **Visualizations/**: Graphs and charts generated during the project.

## Insights
- Missing values were handled effectively to ensure the dataset's consistency.
- Categorical variables were encoded for machine learning compatibility.
- Both models were evaluated, with Logistic Regression performing slightly better than the Decision Tree model.
- Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics offered insights beyond accuracy.

## Conclusion
- Logistic Regression outperformed Decision Tree slightly in terms of accuracy.
- The evaluation metrics helped assess the models comprehensively.
- This churn prediction model can assist businesses in identifying at-risk customers and taking proactive retention actions.

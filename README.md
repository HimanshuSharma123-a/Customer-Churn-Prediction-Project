# Customer Churn Prediction Project 2025

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains customer details such as demographic information, account details, and services used by customers, with the target variable being whether the customer has churned or not.

## Steps
1. Data cleaning: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and remove irrelevant data.
2. Data modification: Select features and split data into training/testing sets.
3. Modeling: Build Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models.
4. Evaluation: Use accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for performance analysis.
5. Visualization: Compare model accuracy and analyze churn distribution.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
